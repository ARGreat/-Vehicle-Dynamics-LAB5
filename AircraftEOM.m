%Purpose: Implement the Non-Linear Aircraft Equations of Motion
%Returns: The derivative of the statevector at the given initial state
function xdot = AircraftEOM(time, aircraft_state, aircraft_surfaces, wind_inertial,aircraft_parameters)
    
    %Code should mirror the Aicraft EOM's slides from class
